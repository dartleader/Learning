Outline:
Project to guess a number randomly generated between 1 and 100

I would like eventually have a program which will solve the number using numerous methods, and compare the iterations required for each method.

Current methods planned are randomly guessing numbers between 1 and 100, and a divisor method which guesses the median number between two known bounds (top and bottom, respectively).
